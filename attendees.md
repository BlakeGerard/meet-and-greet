### Ameya Joshi
Hello everyone! I am looking to land a permanent position as a front-end developer. I have extensive experience working with HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript and the jQuery library. More recently I have also become comfortable working with Git/GitHub. I can work comfortably in a team setting and individually, and have proven my ability to complete projects from start to finish. Last year, I completed the Free Code Camp front-end course and achieved my FCC [Front-End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/coderaj7470/legacy-front-end). Take a look at my [portfolio](http://www.coderaj7470.com), where you will find all of my work and code examples, including a website that I have been upkeeping for several years! Currently, I am learning React, CSS Grid and Sass and I am always up for expanding my knowledge. If you would like to see more, you can view my [GitHub](https://github.com/CoderAJ7470), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/CoderAJ/#) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coderaj7470) pages.

### Sandi K. Terry
Mid-life career changer, I am completely new to coding. I am a lifelong learner and love solving problems so I am pretty excited about becoming a programmer. I am currently taking the IT Support program (taught by Google), HTML5 (from U of M), and both Mindshift and Learning How to Learn (from McMaster University), all on Coursera.  Thanks to Techlahoma, I am also beginning to use Free Code Camp to augment these courses so I can become a programmer faster. You can find me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/langlearnlife), [Github](https://github.com/sktmurdock37), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sandikterry/).

### Austin W Keeton
I am an IT professional with 2 years of on-the-job programming experience at the University of Oklahoma Parking Services office. There I provide product support for their [T2 Systems](https://www.t2systems.com/home) infrastructure. My passion is using programming to improve the lives of my coworkers and, more broadly, laborers everywhere. Over the past two years at Parking I have used Python to automate away monotonous tasks like invoicing, bulk emailing, and data entry. I have also used Python and SQL to query, aggregate, and organize data from the Parking database (Oracle) for auditing financial data, tracking sales, and spotting bad entries. My vision for my future is creating efficient, intuitive web applications to improve the work flow and job-satisfaction of laborers everywhere. Even more, create full-featured and well-documented APIs that allow developers to access my applications with ease. Currently, I am working with MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, React, and Redux to accomplish this dream. To view examples of my code, please visit my [github](https://github.com/austinwk) page. I truly believe that programming has the power to change the lives of people everywhere and would love to be part of the driving force behind that change.
